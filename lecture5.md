1.List all branches:

   - `git branch`-> Lists all branches in your repository.

2.Merge a branch into the current branch:

   - `git merge dev1`-> Merges the changes from the 'dev1' branch into the current branch, typically the 'main' branch.

3.Delete a branch:
   - `git branch -d BRANCH_NAME`-> Deletes the specified branch. This command should only be used after ensuring all changes are committed.

4.Important Note:
   - The 'main' or 'master' branch cannot be deleted.
